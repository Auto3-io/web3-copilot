=============
The Curve DAO
=============

Curve DAO consists of multiple smart contracts connected by `Aragon <https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS>`_. Interaction with Aragon occurs through a `modified implementation <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-aragon-voting>`_ of the `Aragon Voting App <https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/voting>`_. Aragon's standard one token, one vote method is replaced with a weighting system based on locking tokens.

Curve DAO has a token (`CRV <https://etherscan.io/token/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52>`_) which is used for both governance and value accrual.

Source code for the Curve DAO can be found on `Github <https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts>`_.
